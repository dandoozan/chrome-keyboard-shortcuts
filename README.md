# Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts for Chrome.

NOTE: this extension is meant to be used in conjunction with BetterTouchTool (or similar program) because the actions are implemented through the popup (so that they work on all pages, including the "New tab" page). Therefore, an external program is needed to: activate the popup, wait, then send further keys.
