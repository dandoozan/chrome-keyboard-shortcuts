# Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts

Use keyboard shortcuts to perform common actions in Chrome.

NOTE: this extension is meant to be used in conjunction with BetterTouchTool (or similar program) because the actions are implemented through the popup (see below for why). Therefore, an external program is needed to: activate the popup, wait, then send further keys.

Some of the supported actions are:
-   Move tab left/right
-   Move tab to new window
-   Split tabs into side-by-side view
-   Duplicate tab

## FAQ

### Why do the keyboard shortcuts go through the popup?

-   Because otherwise, the shortcuts would not work on some web pages (eg. the new tab page)
-   Also, going through the popup means that I am not loading a script on every single web page, which saves computing resources and also means I don't need access to all webpages (so this way gives more security and privacy for users)
